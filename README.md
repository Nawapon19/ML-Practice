This is a repo for keeping my machine learning exercises.

1. SVM implementation in Python:
   Practice Support Vector Machine Model using Scikit-Learn in Python
   Find clusters of breast cancer data points from texture and radius features

2. Rainfall prediction using Linear regression:
   Practice Linear Regression Model using Scikit-Learn in Python
   Find trends on precipitation level vs. given features

3. Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnosis using Logistic Regression
   Practice Implementing Logistic Regression from scratch in Python
   Training the model with breast cancer dataset then check the result with Logistic Regression in Scikit-Learn

4. Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
   Practice training different machine learning models for classification problem
   Train and predict KNeighborsClassifiers, RandomForestClassifiers, Support Vector Classifiers, and Logistics Regression
   Then compare accuracy scores of training and testing data for all models.

5. K-Means clustering on the handwritten digits data
   Practice K-Means model for multi-label classification problem using digits data from Scikit-Learn 
   Compare the benchmarks of using random initial cluster and k-mean++ isnitial cluster, then plot the result

6. Recognizing HandWritten Digits in Scikit Learn
   Practice Multi-Layer Perceptron model in Scikit-Learn for multi-label classification problem using digits data from Scikit-Learn
   Train Multi-Layer Perceptron model with specific parameters and plot losses of each iteration then check accuracy score of test set
